I'm a third-year PhD candidate in developmental psychology at Stanford University.

From a young age, we learn to carve the world around us into categories. We learn to see the world in terms of dogs and cats, tables and chairs, and through the lens of social categories like gender and race.

I'm primarily interested in how we learn to represent these categories, and what role language plays in that process.

Here are a handful of questions I've been pondering:
- How do we develop category representations? Given the infinite ways in which we could theoretically categorize the world, how do we learn what properties and distinctions are relevant, meaningful, and/or value-laden?
- How does language shape how we think about categories? What do children learn about categories from the way we talk?
- How variable and flexible are our category representations across different contexts, different language experiences, and development?

Other interests of mine include metaphor, non-literal language, and pragmatics, as well as how people usually think about traditional philosophical problems regarding object identity and personal identity. Although psychology is my home, I love learning about perspectives on these issues from philosophy, linguistics, gender studies, race/ethnic studies, and beyond.

Where I am and where I've been
======

**In the academic world**
Currently, I work with [Ellen Markman](http://markmanlab.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2018, where I studied psychology and philosophy. As an undergraduate, I explored the role of bodily experience in understanding language in [Daniel Casasanto](http://casasanto.com)'s lab at UChicago. As an undergraduate summer intern, I studied the development of kind representations in [Susan Carey](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/susan-e-carey)'s lab at Harvard University, and biases in causal reasoning in [Frank Keil](https://cogdevlab.yale.edu/)'s lab at Yale University.

**In the wider world**
I'm a second-generation Asian American woman from New York. I'm an East Coast person at heart, and I've spent most of my life in big cities - New York, Chicago, Beijing, Hong Kong - so the Bay Area has been a change. You can find me climbing things and [exploring caves](https://www.sfbaycaving.org/), or driving anxiously and slowly on the highway (sorry!). I speak English (my native language) and Mandarin (my heritage language). I'm always excited to learn more about Chinese cooking. I've also been involved in the [quizbowl community](http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/) for more than a decade, where I have been particularly active on issues relating to diversity and inclusivity.
