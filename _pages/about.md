I'm a third-year PhD candidate in developmental psychology at Stanford University.

Social categories like gender and race structure so much of our human experience. Yet we're not born knowing all about these categories. Rather, from a young age, we learn to parse our social world in terms of categories. We learn on what basis to group people together, what it means to belong to this or that category, and what expectations and norms to deploy based on someone's category membership.

**I'm primarily interested in how we learn to represent social categories, and what role language plays in that process.** Here are a handful of questions I've been pondering.
- How do we develop representations of social categories? Given the infinite ways in which we could theoretically categorize the world, how do we learn what attributes and distinctions are relevant, meaningful, and/or value-laden?
- How does language shape how we think about social categories? What do children learn about social categories from the way we talk about social categories? How might the way we talk sustain, recreate, or alter the social world we describe?
- How should we reason about social categories, and how can we promote beneficial ways of understanding social categories?

Other interests of mine include metaphor and pragmatics, as well as how people usually think about traditional philosophical problems regarding object identity and personal identity. Although psychology is my home turf, I love learning about perspectives on these issues from philosophy, linguistics, gender studies, race/ethnicity studies, and beyond.

# Where I am and where I've been

## In the academic world (official version)
Currently, I work with [Ellen Markman](https://markmanlab.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2018, where I studied psychology and philosophy. As an undergraduate, I explored the role of bodily experience in understanding language in [Daniel Casasanto](https://casasanto.com)'s lab at UChicago. As an undergraduate summer intern, I studied the development of kind representations in [Susan Carey](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/susan-e-carey)'s lab at Harvard University, and biases in causal reasoning in [Frank Keil](https://cogdevlab.yale.edu/)'s lab at Yale University.

## In the academic world (longer unofficial version)
I grew up in New York with scientist parents who worked in cell biology, but I gravitated towards humanities and social sciences. I was lucky to attend [a high school](https://www.hunterschools.org/high-school) where I learned about psychology and philosophy in classes and [quizbowl](http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/). I loved the [big](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) [weighty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind) [questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language) philosophers asked, but I was more hungry for answers than philosophy seemed to provide.

I went off to Chicago for college (against my parents' desire for me to stay in New York), because I wanted to explore a different big city and meet new people. At [UChicago](http://uchicago.edu/), I dabbled in a bunch of fields before I realized that psychologists *also* considered big weighty questions and could even reach empirical answers (!), so I became a psychology major. I applied to a bunch of psychology labs to learn about research, and the only one who accepted me was [Daniel Casasanto](http://casasanto.com/). In his lab, I thought my life switching and traveling between two languages (English/Mandarin) and cultures (New York/Beijing), and got excited about how language shapes our experience of the world.

I applied to summer research internships my first two summers for a change of scenery. In [Frank Keil](https://cogdevlab.yale.edu/)'s lab' at Yale, I worked with [a fantastic mentor who loved philosophy and movies](https://www.sgbjohnson.com/), learned about developmental psychology for the first time, and got so bored in New Haven I went home to New York every weekend. I wanted to learn more about developmental psychology (the origins of all my questions in childhood) so I went to [Susan Carey](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/susan-e-carey)'s lab at Harvard, where I met lots of philosophy/psychology people, and got hooked on the role of language in how children develop category representations. My senior year, Daniel moved to Cornell so I was adopted by the amazing [Susan Goldin-Meadow](https://voices.uchicago.edu/goldinmeadowlab/), and I dropped my philosophy major to a minor because I couldn't resist taking another cool psychology elective instead of Elementary Logic.

For grad school, I was torn between staying in Chicago or starting a new adventure in the Bay Area. My amazing boyfriend who worked in Chicago said he would support me either way, so off I went to [Stanford](https://psychology.stanford.edu/) to start a PhD in psychology and a long-distance relationship. We managed to reunite in the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now live together in Palo Alto with friends.

## Outside academia
I'm a second-generation Asian American woman. I'm an East Coast person at heart, and I've spent most of my life in big cities - New York, Chicago, Beijing, Hong Kong - so the Bay Area has been a change. You can find me climbing things and [exploring caves](https://www.sfbaycaving.org/), or driving anxiously and slowly on the highway (sorry!). I speak English (my native language) and Mandarin (my heritage language). I'm always excited to learn more about Chinese cooking. I've also been involved in the [quizbowl community](http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/) for more than a decade, where I have been particularly active on issues relating to diversity and inclusivity.
