## Academic bio (official version)
I'm a PhD candidate in developmental psychology at Stanford University, working with [Ellen Markman](https://markmanlab.stanford.edu). I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2018, where I studied psychology and philosophy. As an undergraduate, I explored the role of bodily experience in understanding language in [Daniel Casasanto](https://casasanto.com)'s lab at UChicago. As an undergraduate summer intern, I studied the development of kind representations in [Susan Carey](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/susan-e-carey)'s lab at Harvard University, and biases in causal reasoning in [Frank Keil](https://cogdevlab.yale.edu/)'s lab at Yale University.

## Academic bio (unofficial version)
I grew up in New York with scientist parents who worked in cell biology, but I gravitated towards humanities and social sciences. I was lucky to attend [a high school](https://www.hunterschools.org/high-school) where I learned about psychology and philosophy in classes and [quizbowl](http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/). I loved the [big](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) [weighty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind) [questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language) philosophers asked, but I was more hungry for answers than philosophy seemed to provide.

I went off to Chicago for college, because I wanted to explore a different big city and meet new people. At [UChicago](http://uchicago.edu/), I dabbled in a bunch of fields before I realized that psychologists *also* considered big weighty questions and could even reach empirical answers (!), so I became a psychology major. I applied to a bunch of psychology labs to learn about research, and the only one who took a chance on me was [Daniel Casasanto](http://casasanto.com/). In his lab, I reflected on my experience switching and traveling between two languages (English/Mandarin) and cultures (New York/Beijing), and got excited about how language shapes our experience of the world.

I applied to summer research internships my first two summers for a change of scenery and ways of thinking. In [Frank Keil](https://cogdevlab.yale.edu/)'s lab at Yale, I worked with [a fantastic mentor](https://www.sgbjohnson.com/) who loved philosophy and movies, learned about developmental psychology for the first time, and got so bored in New Haven I went home to New York every weekend. I was curious to learn more about developmental psychology (the origins of all my questions in childhood) so I went to [Susan Carey](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/susan-e-carey)'s lab at Harvard, where I met lots of cool philosophy/psychology people and got hooked on the role of language in how children develop category representations. My senior year, Daniel moved to Cornell so I was adopted by the amazing [Susan Goldin-Meadow](https://voices.uchicago.edu/goldinmeadowlab/), and I dropped my second major in philosophy to a minor because I couldn't resist taking another cool psychology elective instead of Elementary Logic.

For grad school, I was torn between staying in Chicago or starting a new adventure in the Bay Area. I loved the community of people at [Stanford](https://psychology.stanford.edu/), but my boyfriend's then-job tied him to Chicago. With his support, I went off to Stanford start a PhD in psychology and a long-distance relationship. We managed to reunite in the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now live together in Palo Alto with friends.

## Outside academia
I'm a second-generation Asian American woman. I'm an East Coast person at heart, and I've spent most of my life in big cities - New York, Chicago, Beijing, Hong Kong - so the Bay Area has been a change. You can find me climbing things and [exploring caves](https://www.sfbaycaving.org/). I've also been involved in the [quizbowl community](http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/) for more than a decade, where I have been particularly active on issues relating to diversity and inclusivity. I speak English (my native language) and Mandarin (my heritage language).
