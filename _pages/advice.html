  <h2>For prospective graduate students</h2>
</header>

Academia involves an endless transmission of knowledge. Unfortunately, too much about how to approach and navigate academia is left as implicit knowledge and remains mysterious to those who have been historically marginalized from academia.

Here I share some advice learned from my particular experience and positionality in the hopes that at least some of it can be useful and relevant for others. 

Be determined in the face of difficulty, ask questions when you're uncertain, and seek out people who will help and support you. No one would be where they are without help from others!
