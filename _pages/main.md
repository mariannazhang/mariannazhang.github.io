I'm a **developmental cognitive scientist** studying **how children think about social differences, social disparities, and social structures**. 

I'm currently a final-year PhD candidate in developmental psychology at Stanford University, working with [Ellen Markman](https://markmanlab.stanford.edu/) and graduating in June 2024. Starting in August 2024, I'll be starting as a postdoctoral researcher in developmental psychology at New York University, working with [Marjorie Rhodes](https://kidconcepts.org/).

Social categories like gender and race structure much of our society, shaping who gets access to resources, opportunities, and power. Think of the gender wage gap or racial achievement gap, for instance. What do children, growing up in such a society, think about these social differences and disparities that they see and experience? And as children grow up, how do those ways of thinking contribute to maintaining those differences or disparities in the first place? 

I'm particularly interested in how **language** shapes children's thinking about such matters. How might the way we talk sustain, recreate, or alter the social differences and disparities we describe? 

I'm also interested in how children think about the role of **social structures**, since many of the social disparities I'm interested in are ultimately structural in nature. Although thinking about social structures can be challenging for children, and even adults, children are capable of such structural thinking at a young age. How can we harness children's capacity for structural thinking for social good? 

Other random interests of mine include social ontology, conceptual ethics, applied philosophy of language, pragmatics, and speech acts. Although psychology and cognitive science is my home turf, I love learning about perspectives on these issues from philosophy, linguistics, sociology, and beyond.
