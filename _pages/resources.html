  <h2>For prospective graduate students</h2>
</header>

<p>Academia involves an endless transmission of knowledge. Unfortunately, too much about how to approach and navigate academia is left as implicit knowledge and remains mysterious to those who have been historically marginalized from academia.</p>

<p>Here is some advice I've found helpful from others, and from what I've learned in my particular experience and positionality, in the hopes it's useful to you too. I hope publicizing this information can make academia more transparent and inclusive.</p>

<p>Be determined in the face of difficulty, ask questions that you don't know the answer to, and seek out people who will help and support you. No one would be where they are without asking lots of questions and getting help from others!</p>

  <li>Get involved in your institution's psychology department! Take classes, go to talks/seminars, learn about what faculty work on, talk to older psychology majors, talk to undergraduate-facing department members about getting invovled in research (e.g. undergraduate student services officer, director of undergraduate studies, research placement director)</li>
</ul>
