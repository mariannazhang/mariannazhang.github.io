## Philosophy & background

A unifying thread that runs through my research, teaching, and service is understanding how people learn, and what kinds of inputs and environments (what we say and do) allow efficient and effective learning to occur.

I was a Teaching Fellow (TF) for Stanford's [Psych One program](https://psychone.stanford.edu/) in academic year 2019-20, for which I led or co-led 2 sections and graded assignments in autumn 2019, winter 2020, and spring 2020 (online).

I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Stanford's [Introduction to Developmental Psychology (Psych 60)](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=psych+60&collapse=) course, taught by [Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/people.html) and [Erica Yoon](https://ejyoon.github.io/), in spring 2021 and summer 2021.


## Consulting

I am a [Graduate Teaching Consultant](https://ctl.stanford.edu/ta-training-support/graduate-teaching-consultants) and a coordinator for the Graduate Teaching Consultant program at Stanford's [Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL)](https://ctl.stanford.edu/). I'm excited to share what I have learned about teaching, and to learn in turn from fellow teachers and colleagues. I'm particularly interested in fostering learning environments that are supportive and inclusive of diversity.

If you are an instructor or TA for a course at Stanford, CTL offers a variety of services led by Graduate Teaching Consultants, including small group feedback sessions (often conducted as a mid-quarter student evaluation), classroom observation & video recording (feedback on an observed class session), and microteaching (feedback on short teaching demos for a group of TAs). You can learn more about CTL's teaching services on the [CTL teaching support](https://ctl.stanford.edu/teaching-support) page.
