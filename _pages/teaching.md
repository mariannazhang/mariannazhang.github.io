## Philosophy & background

A unifying thread that runs through my research, teaching, and service is understanding how people learn, and what kinds of inputs and environments allow for effective and inclusive learning. I'm particularly interested in practices for equity in teaching and learning.

## Teaching

I'm currently a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Stanford's [HISTORY/FEMGEN 44Q: Gendered Innovations in Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Environment](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=FEMGEN+44Q%3A+Gendered+Innovations+in+Science%2C+Medicine%2C+Engineering%2C+and+Environment&collapse=), a Sophomore Seminar taught by Londa Schiebinger, in spring 2024. If you're a student in the course, please reach out to me for anything related to writing in the course, especially when preparing for writing assignments! I'm here to be a helpful resource to you in your writing journey (e.g., workshopping ideas, getting feedback on thesis statements or outlines).

Previously, I TA'd for Stanford's [Psych One program](https://psychone.stanford.edu/) for 3 quarters (2019-20), [Introduction to Developmental Psychology (Psych 60)](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=psych+60&collapse=) taught by [Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/people.html) and [Erica Yoon](https://ejyoon.github.io/) in spring 2021 and summer 2021, and [Senior Honors Research (Psych 198)](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=psych+198&collapse=) taught by Ellen Markman in autumn 2022. 


## Teaching consulting

For several years, I coordinated the [Graduate Teaching Consultant](https://ctl.stanford.edu/ta-training-support/graduate-teaching-consultants) team at Stanford's [Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL)](https://ctl.stanford.edu/), managing a team of a dozen graduate students who support graduate student teaching on campus through individual consultations, group teaching feedback sessions, and workshops. 

If you are currently a TA or instructor at Stanford, CTL offers a variety of services, including small group feedback sessions (often conducted as a mid-quarter student evaluation), classroom observation & video recording (feedback on an observed class session), and microteaching (feedback on short teaching demos for a group of TAs). You can learn more about CTL's teaching services at [CTL teaching support](https://ctl.stanford.edu/teaching-support).
