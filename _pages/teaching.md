## Philosophy & background

A unifying thread that runs through my research, teaching, and service is understanding how people learn, and what kinds of inputs and environments allow efficient and effective learning to occur. I'm particularly interested in implementing equity in teaching and learning.

## Teaching

I will be a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Stanford's [Senior Honors Research (Psych 198)](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=psych+198&collapse=) in autumn 2022, where I will be teaching research and professional skills to Stanford psychology students in the [honors program](https://psychology.stanford.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/psychology-honors-program). 

Previously, I was a Teaching Fellow (TF) for Stanford's [Psych One program](https://psychone.stanford.edu/) in academic year 2019-20, for which I led or co-led 2 sections and graded assignments in autumn 2019, winter 2020, and spring 2020 (online), and a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Stanford's [Introduction to Developmental Psychology (Psych 60)](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=psych+60&collapse=) course taught by [Hyo Gweon](http://sll.stanford.edu/people.html) and [Erica Yoon](https://ejyoon.github.io/) in spring 2021 and summer 2021.


## Teaching consulting

I currently co-coordinate the [Graduate Teaching Consultant](https://ctl.stanford.edu/ta-training-support/graduate-teaching-consultants) team at Stanford's [Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL)](https://ctl.stanford.edu/). I help manage a team of a dozen graduate students who support graduate student teaching on campus through individual consultations, group teaching feedback sessions, and workshops. 

If you are a TA or instructor for a course at Stanford, CTL offers a variety of services, including small group feedback sessions (often conducted as a mid-quarter student evaluation), classroom observation & video recording (feedback on an observed class session), and microteaching (feedback on short teaching demos for a group of TAs). You can learn more about CTL's teaching services on the [CTL teaching support](https://ctl.stanford.edu/teaching-support) page. If you are a graduate student, you'll be serviced by the Graduate Teaching Consultant team.
