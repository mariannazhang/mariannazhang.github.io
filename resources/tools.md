# Browsing the internet
**[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)**. The fastest browser around, and well-supported across many sites. I love all the extensions you can install. I also love how easy it is to access tabs open on my phone from my computer, and send tabs from my computer to my phone. The one drawback is that Chrome is a memory hog! On the rare occasions when Google Chrome doesn't do the trick, I use Firefox/Waterfox.

**[OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/)** (for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Are you a 100 tab maniac like me? Save your poor computer CPU/memory and speed up your computer by collapsing tabs into a single tab of pages that you can reopen at a click. I like OneTab better than [TabCloud](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabcloud/npecfdijgoblfcgagoijgmgejmcpnhof?hl=en) because it's easier to see the names of pages and to see many pages at once. I used to use The Great Suspender, but it keeps each tab loaded and cluttered, and it now features malware.

# Managing accounts and passwords
**[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)** (free for Chrome, Android; premium version available). Everyone needs a password manager. Reusing the same username/password(s) across websites is extremely risky, and if you try varying passwords, they can get hard to remember. Bitwarden generates secure passwords, stores username/password info, and autofills the info on sign-in pages, and it's all secured using a single master password. Occasionally I will need to manually correct a website domain, or manually store a password, or manually fill in a password if the auto-fill button is blocked, but it is a pinch 95% of the time. I recommend it over LastPass, because you can use it across all your devices for free.

# Managing and storing files
**Google Drive** (free; many universities offer unlimited storage, or you can pay for more storage). I love how easy it is to collaborate in real-time with others using Google Docs. If I am creating a file that I know multiple people will be working on, I often go straight for a Google Doc or Google Sheet. The layout of Google Docs is extremely similar to Microsoft Word, and the syntax of Google Sheets is very similar to Microsoft Excel. The one tricky issue that sometimes annoys me is juggling personal (assures long-term access, but often limited storage unless you want to pay for more) vs institutional Google Drive accounts (many universities offer unlimited storage, but you may not be at a university long-term, so file access may not outlive your institutional affiliation). By habit, I share all files with both accounts, but let me know if you know of a workaround.

with **Google Drive for Desktop** (formerly Google File Stream). I cannot emphasize how much I love Google Drive for Desktop. Have you ever found yourself navigating two parallel file structures, one on your local computer filled with local files, and another on Google Drive filled with Google Docs/Slides/Sheets? Google Drive for Desktop combines the two by allowing you to access Google Drive locally using file explorer. I now put everything on Google Drive, including Microsoft Word and other files, and I can choose to open files locally (eg in Microsoft Word; it will warn you if others are simultaneously accessing the same file) or in Google Drive (eg to open in Google Docs and/or to share with others).

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) with desktop app (free).

# Finding and managing papers
**[Feedly](https://feedly.com/)**.

**Google Scholar**: [search](https://scholar.google.com/), [alerts](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts), and [button](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-scholar-button/ldipcbpaocekfooobnbcddclnhejkcpn) (extension for Chrome).

Library Access

**Zotero** (free) with **Zotero Connector** (free Chrome extension). If I'm browsing my computer

 paper strikes me as interesting, I will use Zotero Conn

# Reading papers
I generally read papers in successive layers of detail

For important articles, as I read, I highlight in different colors: green for important terms and definitions, blue for major points, yellow for minor points/evidence, orange/red for counter-points or counter-arguments, purple for "side-note that I find very interesting". Highlighting as I read helps me keep track of the structure of the paper, and helps me jump to important sections on future reads.

Immediately after reading an article, I write a short summary of the paper (and my take on the paper if I have one) in Zotero for my future self to reference. I can't count how many times I've blankly stared at an already-highlighted article that jogs nothing in my brain, and then felt a surge of gratitude upon seeing my past self's summary.

**Adobe Reader**.

Zotero PDF reader (beta).

# Taking notes
**[Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/)**. I love how easy it is to take notes, organize notes, and search notes in OneNote. You can not only type text, but also add in drawings, pictures, screenshots, URLs, links to files, and links to other notes in OneNote. I personally organize my notes using separate notebooks per institution (e.g. UChicago, Stanford, summers), separate tabs for different classes/types of events (e.g. advisor meetings, Structure of Discourse, Explanation), and separate pages for each meeting/topic (e.g. 5/19: politeness & face). You can search for text within a page, tab, or notebook, or everywhere. Similar products include [Evernote](http://evernote.com/).

**[Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)** (free app for Android) for quick random thoughts, or reference information that I need to frequently access from my phone. When I have a shower thought or a random idea pop into my head, I pull out my phone and jot it down into Google Keep. I can access Google Keep from my computer to, to pull into OneNote or somewhere else. I also have several notes pinned with information I need to frequently access from my phone and can't be trusted to remember, e.g. my student ID number, frequent flier numbers, locker codes (you can also store these in LastPass, but I often want to access them more quickly than a password-secure app allows, and I'm comfortable storing them secured only by my phone unlock security), and frequently used recipes.

# Scheduling, managing, and tracking time and tasks
**[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)**. color-code meetings, integrate tasks, multiple time zones, birthdays from Google Contacts

**Google Tasks** with Google Calendar.

**[youcanbook.me](https://youcanbook.me/)** (free; premium version available) for allowing people to schedule one-on-one meetings with you (e.g. office hours, online testing) based on current availability in your calendar. [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) (free; premium version available) is also a similar alternative.

**[Whenisgood](http://whenisgood.net/)** (free) for polling people for event scheduling. I like it more than the very similar [when2meet](http://when2meet.com/) because you can edit the poll after creating the poll, and access all your responses/polls in a single account. I like it better than [Doodle](http://doodle.com/), especially for polling a wide range of times, because dates/times are presented in a more intuitive calendar-like grid, and it is easier to click and drag than to click multiple times to indicate availability. One advantage of Doodle, however, is that you can offer participants an if-need-be option.

**[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/)** (free; premium version available) for tracking your overall time activity.

**[Toggl](https://toggl.com/)** (free) for tracking your time by project. Tracking time spent on a project, particular if getting paid hourly.

# Cooking
**[Omnivore's Cookbook](http://omnivorescookbook.com/)** for written English-language Chinese recipes when cooking in the United States. Northern Chinese, slightly fewer recipes than The Woks of Life.
**[The Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/)** for written English-language Chinese recipes when cooking in the United States. Lots of recipes, many Shanghainese. I really enjoy their essays and descriptions too!
[Red House Spice](https://redhousespice.com/) for written English-language Chinese recipes. Not that many recipes, mostly Sichuanese.
[Souped Up Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3HjB3X8jeENm46HCkI0Inw) for video English-language Chinese recipes.
[小高姐](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCKlp1JI9Yg3-cUjKPdD3mw) for video Mandarin-language Chinese recipes, from a Beijing perspective.
**[Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/)** for English-language Japanese recipes. Beautiful videos on YouTube as well.
J. Kenji Lopez Alt (The Food Lab, YouTube channel) and Samin Nosrat (Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat book and TV show) for cooking principles and humor.

For woks, I recommend **a carbon steel wok** (ideally round-bottom if your setup works) and **metal spatula** (that matches the curvature of your wok and is stiff enough you can break up too-large chunks of food at the last minute in the wok). Avoid non-stick woks like the plague (the cheap price may be tempting, but the coating can't handle high heat and will flake off). Cast iron tends to be super heavy and cumbersome, and takes forever to heat up. If you have a gas stove that can be fit to hold a round-bottom wok, I recommend you get a round-bottom wok: it's a lot easier to flip food properly and heat the wok properly. If you have an electric stove, a flat-bottom wok will do, but you may need to use more oil than you usually do to make sure food doesn't stick and use more energy to flip than a flat-bottom one.
